# Solar Simulation Analysis : NSRDB x SAM

## Background

The increasing importance of renewable energy sources, particularly solar power, underscores the need for robust data analytics and simulation capabilities to inform decision-making. This analysis introduces students to the utilization of two key tools: 

1. National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) : a high temporal and spatial resolution dataset consisting of the three most widely used measurements of solar radiation—global horizontal, direct normal, and diffuse horizontal irradiance—as well as other meteorological data. [More information to NSRDB data](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/about/what-is-the-nsrdb)

2. System Advisor Model (SAM) : a performance and financial model designed to estimate the cost of energy for grid-connected power projects based on installation and operating costs and system design in order to facilitate decision making for people involved in the renewable energy industry.

## Instructions for using this package:

The accompanying Jupyter Notebook, [NSRDB_SAM_Analysis.ipynb](./Jupyter%20Notebooks/NSRDB_SAM_Analysis.ipynb), serves as a starting point for this analysis. From here, further instructions and workflow details are provided.
